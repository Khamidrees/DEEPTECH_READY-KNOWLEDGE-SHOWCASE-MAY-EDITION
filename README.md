# DEEPTECH_READY-KNOWLEDGE-SHOWCASE-MAY-EDITION

This is a **3MTT DeepTech Ready Knowledge Showcase** project developed by **Khalid Muhammad Idris** in collaboration with **Sulaiman Hamisu Sani**.  
It demonstrates the skills and concepts learned so far in the **DeepTech Ready program**, with a focus on **data processing**, **object detection using machine learning**, and **practical application of AI tools**.

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project consists of two main parts:

### 1. **Object Detection using Machine Learning**
- Implemented using a pre-trained model to detect digits (MNIST dataset).
- The model is trained and tested in a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab.
- Result visualization is provided through processed images.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Analysis of Nigeria House Prices Dataset**
- Raw data was cleaned, missing values handled, and irrelevant features removed.
- Insightful visualizations were generated to understand data distributions and relationships.
- The cleaned dataset was saved for further analysis and modeling.
